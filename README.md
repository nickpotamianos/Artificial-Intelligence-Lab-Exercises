## Overview

This repository includes various AI exercises and reports focusing on the implementation and analysis of algorithms such as search algorithms, decision trees, and logic programming using Prolog.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1 - AI Algorithms Analysis

This exercise compares several AI algorithms, such as BFS, A*, and BestFS, in solving a grid-based problem. The analysis includes:
- Comparison of Manhattan and Euclidean heuristics.
- Evaluation of algorithms' performance in terms of optimality and speed.
- A detailed comparison of solution lengths, number of steps, and execution times.

### Exercise 2 - Decision Trees and Information Gain

In this exercise, decision trees are built using information gain to classify health data related to heart attacks. The report includes:
- Calculations of entropy and information gain for various attributes.
- Construction of a decision tree using the Weka tool for visualization.
- Derivation of decision rules based on the constructed tree.

### Exercise 3 - Elevator Problem using Logic Programming

This exercise focuses on modeling the behavior of an elevator system using logic programming in Prolog. The report covers:
- Definition of predicates to describe the state of the elevator and passenger behavior.
- Implementation of rules for elevator movement, passenger pickup, and drop-off.
- Solutions for optimizing elevator operations based on logic.
